.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility verifies and repairs
.Tn Universal Disk Format
file systems (more commonly known as
.Tn UDF
file systems).
.Pp
The first form of
.Nm
preens the specified file systems.
It is normally started by
.Xr fsck 8
run from
.Pa /etc/rc
during automatic reboot, when an UDF file system is detected.
When preening file systems,
.Nm
will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.
If more serious problems are found,
.Nm
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.
.Pp
The second form of
.Nm
checks the specified file systems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before
making any changes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXoptions
